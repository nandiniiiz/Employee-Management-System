# Employee-Management-System

<p>
  I have made a compact yet feature-rich employee management system where admins can create tasks, assign them to users, and monitor their status, including completed, pending, or failed. Users can view assigned tasks, accept or forward them, and update their progress by marking tasks as completed or failed, ensuring streamlined task tracking and accountability.
